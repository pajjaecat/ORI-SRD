All the files (data) called within the notebooks described here are located in [Pickle_files](../Pickle_files). When executing the notebooks, ensure the file location is set correctly (keep the same directory structure as this repository, and it should work just fine) and that all the compressed files (.zip, .7z) are decompressed in the corresponding folder. 
> As exemple decompress the content of the file [Pickle_files/ElectricNation.zip](../Pickle_files/ElectricNation.zip)  in a the same directory as  [Pickle_files/ElectricNation/]
