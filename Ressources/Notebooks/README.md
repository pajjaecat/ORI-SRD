All the files (data) called within the notebooks described here are located in [Pickle_files](../Pickle_files). When executing the notebooks, ensure the file location is set correctly (keep the same directory structure as this repository, and it should work just fine) and that all the compressed files (.zip, .7z) are decompressed in the corresponding folder. 
> As example decompress the content of the file [Pickle_files/ElectricNation.zip](../Pickle_files/ElectricNation.zip)  in the same directory as  [Pickle_files/ElectricNation/]




## Brief description of each  notebook

##### [CleanDataSTLaurentDeJourdes](CleanDataSTLaurentDeJourdes.ipynb) 
> > Clean the network's input data (Hv & Lv Prod, Load demand) and save the results to be recalled when needed.

##### [STLaurentDeJourdes_2](STLaurentDeJourdes_2.ipynb)
> > Simulations of the Voltage rise on [Civaux's](../Pickle_files/CIVAUX.p) network when the controlled HV producer is: 
> > - not injecting into the network;
> > - injecting into the network with no constraints considered; 
> > - injecting into the network with a maximum Voltage Rise threshold considered on the HV buses.


##### [2021_2022_KnownFuture](2021_2022_KnownFuture.ipynb)
> > Simulations using the [Voltage Rise control Block scheme](../Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf) with the block **PRED** having a perfect knowledge of the future in parallel to speed up the process.


##### [2021_2022_Persistence](2021_2022_Persistence.ipynb) and [2021_2022_Persistence2](2021_2022_Persistence2.ipynb)
> > Simulations using the [Voltage Rise control Block scheme](../Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf) with the block **PRED** using persistence of the previous instant as prediction method, respectively for $max\\_ vm\\_ pu = 1.0250$ and $max\\_vm\\_pu = 1.0225$ 


##### [2021_2022_PersistenceRob](2021_2022_PersistenceRob.ipynb)
> > Simulations using the [Robust Voltage Rise control Block scheme](../Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf) with the block **PRED** using persistence of the previous instant as prediction method.

##### [RNN_Train_StLaurentDeJourdes](RNN_Train_StLaurentDeJourdes.ipynb) and [RNN_Sim_StLaurentDeJourdes](RNN_Sim_StLaurentDeJourdes.ipynb)
> > - Create and Train a Recurrent Neural Network ([RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) of type LSTM to predict some values; 
> > - Use the previously trained RNN to predict the next $\tilde{X}(k)$ and $\tilde{Y}(k)$ based on the sliding history $Z(k)$ of the past twelve daylight hours. [Figures](../Figures) contains several comparison plots of the real variables and their prediction.

##### [2021_2022_RNN](2021_2022_RNN.ipynb) 
> > Simulations using the [Voltage Rise control Block scheme](../Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf) with the block **PRED** based on the RNN created and trained in [RNN_Train_StLaurentDeJourdes](RNN_Train_StLaurentDeJourdes.ipynb) in parallel.

##### [VoltageRiseBinaryUpdated](VoltageRiseBinaryUpdated.ipynb)
> >  Using a power flow in parallel, compute the maximum voltage rise on the lower network (and convert it into a binary variable) from Jan-01-2020 to  June-01-2022.

##### Numerical Voltage Rise RNN  
> > - [VoltageRiseNum_Train](VoltageRiseNum_Train.ipynb) - Create and Train an RNN to predict the value of the maximum Voltage rise. 
> > - [VoltageRiseNum_Pred](VoltageRiseNum_Pred.ipynb) - Use the previously trained RNN to predict the maximum Voltage rise and compare the results to that of a simple power flow. 

##### Binary Voltage Rise RNN
> > - [VoltageRiseBin_Train](VoltageRiseBin_Train.ipynb) - Create and train a RNN to Predict a binary variable (1 or 0), whether a voltage rise (above a predefined threshold i.e. 1.0250 ) will occur or not.
> > - [VoltageRiseBin_Pred](VoltageRiseBin_Pred.ipynb) - Use the previously trained RNN to predict whether a voltage rise will occur or not in the next period

##### [2021_2022_RNN_Robust_All_Models](2021_2022_RNN_Robust_All_Models.ipynb)
> >  Combine the prediction of three RNN models to evaluate whether an exceeding of the defined maximum voltage rise will occur in next step. The user with the help of  ``paramUser``  get to choose the combination or the unique model to use. This is an implementation of the Combined RNN prediction described in Section 2.1 of [Voltage Rise control Block scheme](../Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf) in parallel.

##### [2021_2022_SimResAll_RNN](2021_2022_SimResAll_RNN.ipynb)
> >  Compare the results of the simulations given by [2021_2022_RNN_Robust_All_Models](2021_2022_RNN_Robust_All_Models.ipynb) when using each or a combination of the RNN models.
