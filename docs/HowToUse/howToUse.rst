How to Use
##############
 
 
This section gives an in-depth view of how to efficiently navigate and use the
`Ori's Github Repository <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD>`_.


Set Up Your System
--------------------
**********************


Download the repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The repository is available  `here <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD>`_. After downloading, make sure to check out
its `Architecture <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/Ressources/README.md>`_ to comprehend how the files
are organized.



Create  new environment 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the code presented here is written and tested with `python3.7 <https://www.python.org/>`_, making use of the
powerful `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/)>`_. To reproduce, please follow the instructions
`here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48787250/set-up-virtualenv-using-a-requirements-txt-generated-by-cond>`_ to
create a new environment. Use either of files `environment.yml <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/environment.yml>`_
or  `requirement.txt <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/requirements.txt>`_  or both to do so. These files
contain all the necessary packages and libraries (from the relevant channels) to use to avoid compatibility issues.


Some Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We define in this section some Variables used in the code and bellow.

============================  =====================================================================================
         **Definitions**                **Meaning**
============================  =====================================================================================
**LV\\lv Prod\\Sgens**         Lower voltage generators (producteurs BT)
**HV\hv Prod or Sgens**        High voltage generators (producteurs HTA)
**Upper Network**              The network where is located the Main Poste Source
**Lower Network**              The network to study, which is a small branch of the Upper Network
**Voltage Rise**               Elevation de tension
**Voltage Rise event**         | An event where the value of the  maximum voltage rise :math:`vm\_ pu\_ max` 
                               | detected at the output of block **PF** is above that of the maximum authorised threshold  
                               | :math:`defAuth\_ hvBus\_ V_{rise}^{max}` (defined as :data:`oriVariables.defAuth_hvBus_vRiseMax`) 
                               | given as input to block **PF/OPF** .
============================  =====================================================================================


By default, we consider |uppernet| and |lowernet| as the upper and lower Network, respectively. 


.. warning:: 
     Please **READ** |vRiseBlockScheme|_ .
     
  
Add Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   This step is only necessary if one wants to apply Ori to networks different from |uppernet| and |lowernet|.
   Otherwise, all the necessary files to smoothly run simulations for the previously mentioned networks are
   already present in the repository.
 
 
- Add networks (lower and upper) files to  `Pickle_files <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/tree/main/Ressources/Pickle_files>`_;
- Add the networks' input files to `Excel_files <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/tree/main/Ressources/Excel_files>`_. 

   - Each of the Hv Prod must have its own associated file;
   - All the Lv Prods (i.e. all the LV Prods in the Upper network) must be aggregated in a unique file;
   - All the Load (i.e. all the load in the Upper network) must be aggregated in a unique file.




Apply the |vRiseBlockScheme|_ 
-------------------------------
**********************************


To apply the |vRiseBlockScheme|_, we propose the following steps. 


Define variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal here is to define all the default variables to use for all simulations in a file. All the necessary variables
are described in :ref:`defaultVariables` and can be modified there. Remember that modifying a variable's value will
affect all the modules and notebooks using the variable.


Clean your data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cleaning the network's input data is an essential part of the process. In this case, there is no step-by-step to follow
because the data might vastly vary from one problem to another. An example of how one might apply this process is
available in :ref:`RstCleanDataSTLaurentDeJourdes`.


Run Simulations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The simulations can be run with different models of the prediction block **PRED**. This section covers three of them,
that are

#. `Future Known`_
#. `Persistence`_;
#. `Recurrent Neural Network`_.

The first two are easily implementable, while the third is more complex (Advanced Users). For each case, we provide a
corresponding tutorial (using the default networks ST LAURENT and CIVAUX ) from which inspiration can be drawn. Check
out section :ref:`Tutorials`, for a succinct list of all available tutorials.

Future Known
=============
For comparison purposes, the simulations must first be run, supposing the prediction block has perfect knowledge of the
future. See :ref:`Rst2021_2022_KnownFuture` for the associated tutorials.

Persistence
===========
The second presen


Recurrent Neural Network
