Welcome to SRD-ORI documentation!
=================================

Welcome to the official documentation of the `ODRI project <https://www.s2e2.fr/projets/odri/>`_  fifth axe **ORI** (Offre de Racordement Intelligente) or Flexible connexion proposal. 

-----------

------------
 
ORI's primary goal is to provide tools to help `SRD <https://www.srd-energies.fr/>`_ decide in which specificities an ORI should be proposed to new renewable energy producers demanding to be connected to the electric distribution Network. 

To help in this endeavour, we have developed the backbone of the project that is  `The voltage rise detection block scheme <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/Ressources/Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf>`_.

.. warning:: 
   Please **READ** `The voltage rise detection block scheme <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/Ressources/Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf>`_ before reading everything else.
   
To implement the `The voltage rise detection block scheme <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/blob/main/Ressources/Docs/VRiseControlBlockScheme.pdf>`_ ,
check out the sections : 
   - :doc:`howToUse` to get a step by step process to apply to any type of network;
   - :doc:`AvailableTutorials` to see the differents available tutorials to get inspired of for the implementation.
   



This documentation offers an in-depth view of the main functions used in the tutorials accessible in the folder `~/Ressources/Notebooks/ <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/tree/main/Ressources/Notebooks>`_ of the  `project's GitHub <https://github.com/pajjaecat/ORI-SRD/tree/main>`_. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
