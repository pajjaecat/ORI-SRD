# ORI-SRD
This repository provides codes, examples, and tutorials of all the work accomplished in the first six months as a Control-Command Data-Scientist in SRD. Everything is related to the  [ODRI project](https://www.s2e2.fr/projets/odri/) fifth axe ORI (Offre de Racordement Intelligente) or Flexible connexion proposal. The main goal is to provide tools to help [SRD](https://www.srd-energies.fr/) decide in which specificities an ORI should be proposed to new renewable energy producers demanding to be connected to the electric distribution Network. 


All the code presented here is written in [python](https://www.python.org/), making use of the powerful [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). A list of the library and packages needed to run the notebooks and modules is availble in [package-list](package-list.txt).
