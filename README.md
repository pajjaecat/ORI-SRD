# ORI-SRD
This repository provides codes, examples, and tutorials of all the work accomplished as a Control-Command Data-Scientist in [SRD](https://www.srd-energies.fr/). Everything is related to the  [ODRI project](https://www.s2e2.fr/projets/odri/) fifth axe ORI (Offre de Racordement Intelligente) or Flexible connexion proposal. The main goal is to provide tools to help SRD decide in which specificities an ORI should be proposed to new renewable energy producers demanding to be connected to the electric distribution Network. 

[Ressources](Ressources/) contains more explanations and tutorials about the said work and [docs](docs/) contains the files related to the [documentation](https://ori-srd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

#### IMPORTANT
All the code presented here is written and tested with [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/), making use of the powerful [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). A list of all necessary libraries, their version and their repository is available in [Packages_List](Packages_List.txt). 

To reproduce follow the instruction [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48787250/set-up-virtualenv-using-a-requirements-txt-generated-by-conda) to create a new environment (using either [environment.yml](environment.yml) or [requirement.txt](requirements.txt) or both) with all the needed libraries from the indexed channel to avoid all compatibility issues.
